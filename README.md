# Stop Watch Chrome Extension
Installing Chrome extensions manually from GitHub is a great way to pass around extensions if they are a work-in-progress or otherwise don't need to be in the Chrome store.

## Installation
> 1. Clone Repo or Download Zip
> 1. Visit `chrome://extensions/` and turn on `Developer mode`
> 1. Click `load unpacked` button and navigate to the folder you downloaded from **GitHub**
That's it enjoy!
