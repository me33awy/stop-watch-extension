# Stop Watch Chrome Extension
Installing Chrome extensions manually from GitHub is a great way to pass around extensions if they are a work-in-progress or otherwise don't need to be in the Chrome store.

1. Clone Repo or Download Zip
2. Visit chrome://extensions/ and turn on "Developer mode"
3. Click "Load unpacked" button and navigate to the folder you downloaded from GitHub
That's it enjoy!
